#VAriable Names
"""
It is important to always have a discriptive variable name, for clarity and collaborative ease.
Rules for Variable names are
Camel Case
myVarName - Capital first letter from the second word
Pascal Case
MyVariableName - capitalize the first letter of each word
Snake Case
my_variable_name - adding an underscore to each word
